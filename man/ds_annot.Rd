\title{Bioc-container specific data set annotation extraction functions}
\usage{
ds_annot(x, meta = NULL, validate = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{SummarizedExperiment, ExpressionSet or DGEList}

\item{meta}{a list of description stuff for the dataset, this can act to
override what's there, already}

\item{validate}{single logical, check results}

\item{...}{additional args (ignored for now)}
}
\description{
Takes dataset-level annotion as stored by each type. DGEList has
no such slot, unfortunately, and thus gets the default. SE has a
metadata slot and can provide url and description. eSet just has
a character annotation and can provide a description.
}
\details{
This is an internal helper function.
